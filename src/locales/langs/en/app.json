    "aboutTitle": "About FATE OS, INC.",
    "founderTitle": "Mei Zhu He – Founder of FATE OS, INC.",
    "founderBio": "Mei Zhu He, a Chinese-American born on June 20, 1957, in Shanghai, China, is the sole founder of FATE OS, INC.",
    "visionary": "A visionary with profound insight into destiny systems, Ms. He currently resides in Los Angeles, USA. On May 14, 2025, she independently established FATE OS, INC. in the state of Delaware, with the mission of bringing ancient metaphysical wisdom to all of humanity through modern technology.",
    "inspiration": "Fate OS was not the result of meticulous technical research, but the spark of inspiration from an unplanned, seemingly trivial moment—like a message of destiny suddenly \"pushed\" to her by the universe. Through this revelation, she realized that fate is not only something to be read, but something that can be pre-set.",
    "platform": "FATE OS, INC. is the world's first metaphysical platform to integrate a '1 to 60 numerical system' with a triangular structure of fate. Within a few minutes, users can gain insight into whether they are in a favorable or unfavorable life phase—and grasp the overall trajectory of their destiny—empowering them to plan ahead, seize turning points, and avoid misfortune.",
    "origin": "The origin of the Fate OS system dates back to 2021, when I began publishing metaphysical insights on X (formerly Twitter) under the account @he_precise. Years of public analysis and user engagement laid the groundwork for what has now become Fate OS.",
    "order": "To her astonishment, she discovered that the universe has never allowed human destiny to unfold in complete chaos. On the contrary, it has long set a unique trajectory for every life—encoded within an underlying order.",
    "decode": "For thousands of years, humanity has questioned fate, yet no one has ever truly 'decoded' this structure. Until now. Fate OS emerges to unveil a destiny system that was encoded by the universe but never discovered.",
    "seeDestiny": "Destiny has not suddenly appeared; we have simply gained the tools to finally see it.",
    "structure": "Destiny is not a mystery—it is a structure. Just as 1 + 1 = 2, every life begins with a sequence of numbers and moves along a precise trajectory. The triangle is not a mere symbol; it is a formula. Within this formula lies the blueprint of one's fate.",
    "calculation": "Fate OS is not about prediction—it is about precise calculation. It reveals the universal laws that were written long ago—laws that can now be seen.",
    "newEra": "Fate OS is her systematic attempt to usher in a new era of destiny—one that is predictable, plannable, and even programmable.",
    "tbtIntro": "Around 1,300 years ago: The most revealing line in the 59th prophecy of Tui Bei Tu, one of China's most well-known ancient prophetic texts, is this Ode:",
    "tbtOde": "Holding the lot-drawing tube, the bamboo sticks are removed.",
    "tbtMeaning": "This single verse unveils a revolutionary future: Humanity will live in a time where destiny no longer needs to be divined. The need for fortune-telling disappears—not because destiny becomes irrelevant, but because it has already been predefined.",
    "designFate": "Even billionaires and powerful leaders have long relied on astrology and prediction to navigate uncertainty. But in the future envisioned by Fate OS, humanity gains access to tools that enable them to design their own fate—transforming destiny from something unknown to something settable.",
    "tbtOde2Intro": "As the Ode suggests:",
    "tbtOde2": "The tube remains in hand, but the sticks are gone.",
    "tbtOde2Meaning": "This means the old practice of fortune-telling will fade away, and the power of destiny will truly return to the hands of each individual.",
    "future": "Fate OS serves not only all of humanity today, but also every future life yet to come into this world"
